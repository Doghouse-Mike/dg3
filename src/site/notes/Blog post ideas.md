My kinda unique viewpoint as someone who’s not a tech blogger, or even reliant on this stuff for their day to day income. Just has an interest, is a nerd, aspiring jack of all trades etc. Bonus is that I’ll be wanting to *do* more stuff that is interesting, so that I’ve got something to write about.
