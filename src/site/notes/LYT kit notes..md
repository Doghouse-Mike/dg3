#LYT

Use less folders than you think your need, use links *more* than you think you need. 

Links are strong connections

Tags are weak connections

Use both for flexibility. 

Nested tags?

Can update/change tags, and it’ll auto populate and change them *all* in whatever notes. 

Look into “Home” note for [ideas](ideas.md)/pointers

Writings MOC for pointers and [ideas](ideas.md) too.

#todo Add links to named notes from here. 

Concepts as paragraphs rather than just lists. 

Oooh, Interest MOC sounds good. Like here’s some random crap I’m interested in, see where that builds/grows. 

Need to make a note in here of where I get to in the video when I leave off, to minimise going over the same thing again/picking up where I left off. 

So can put tags into the MOC, and that gives me quick links to them. Like “here’s all the tags” so they’re quick to get to. 

The PKM MOC included looks like a good list of resources to look up. 

#todo Look into links in [[PKM MOC\|PKM MOC]]

Note *making* vs note *taking*. 

Taking needs it’s place, but need to make room for thinking, and note making. 

Jeez, fuck doing the actual course though, *do not* have $1k to drop on that. The obsidian course *maybe*, but I’m not sure there’ll be $100 worth of stuff in there I couldn’t dig up on my own. 

Hmm, I wonder if some kind soul has leaked either of the courses?

#todo check torrent sites for LYT courses. 

Somehow only just decided that I need a keyboard shortcut for “New Daily Note”. Saves the quitting and reloading when I open Obsidian and it’s still on yesterday’s note. All the modifiers and N. Ctrl-shift-option-cmd-N

Calendar view is handy/quick for making/getting to daily notes too. 

Ooh, quick add plugin. Get that, quickly adds to daily notes from anywhere. 

Note refactor too. Cmd-shift-N will take highlighted text, turn it into a new note, and leave a link to that new note in place of the original text. That will be handy. Will be most handy for pulling stuff out of daily notes. 

Some guy called Francisco has vids on task And project management within Obisidian. 

#todo find Francisco’s resources on task/project management within Obsidian.

So part of the idea with LYT is for the system to be able to evolve with me. Not rigid. 

Think I’m done with the video, gone into a Q+A session, and it’s not super relevant. 

So from here, it’s notes on the beginners guide video’s which start from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd)

Think that gave me some framing for links and their uses. 

Vid 2: Basics of Markdown. 

Probably won’t get anything new out of this one, got the basics down pretty good I think. 

Links-Strong direct connection

Tags-can cmd-click to get a quick search of that tag. 

Italics, bold, blah blah. 

Lists

- one
- Two
- Three
- Etc

# Headers
## Headers
### Headers All the way down to 6
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### See, This is the Smallest Header, H6

Weird that I assume the [theme](theme.md) I’m using is all capsing things on smaller headers. Interesting. 

Numbered lists? Like 

1. Uno
2. dos
3. Tres
4. Etc
5. Etc
6. Etc
Til double enter

Vid 3

Keys to much power. 

Settings ideas. 

Simple ideas build into complex systems. If you go complex from the start, things will break. 

Must’ve skipped around a bit, or not found useful stuff in the in between vids. This is number 5. Oh, 4 was just themes, meh, think I’m good for now. 

# Video 5: Hotkeys
- Cmd click to follow links
- Cmd-e to swap edit/preview mode. 
- cmd-o quick switcher
- Cmd-shift-f search
- Cmd-opt-left arrow/right arrow is back/forwards. Good for digging through history/where I’ve been. 
- Cmd-n new note
- Remember cmd-shift-alt-ctrl-n is daily note. Opens it if it exists, creates it if it doesn’t.
- Cmd-click on note In file browser/search to open in new pane. 

# Video 6: Just Start. Now

Last one before work! 2022-04-08 13:19

So not really going to be able to action this one right away!

A bit of motivation though, which is nice. Hopefully keep the ball rolling on me making stuff. 

So gotta get moving, but will be checking out his other vids, probably being a bit more pick n choosy. But I think it’s helped, and I’ll be flying around Obsidian a bit more than I have been.
