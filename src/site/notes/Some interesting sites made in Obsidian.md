# Some Interesting Sites Made in Obsidian

Mostly gleaned from [the roundup](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/2022-04-22/), a few [publish](publish.md) sites to steal things from. 

I like the way [this one](https://lab.marconoris.com/About/Amanda+Cuesta) uses the sliding panes thing, need to check if mine is doing that. Especially as more stuff goes up and there are more links between notes/pages. Not sure what it does for handling URL‚Äôs though, like if you wanted to link to a specific page. Tested, is all good, gives you the direct URL to the current page. 

[This](https://www.andricheli.com/02Blog/Home) has a bit of a photography bent. The way the ‚Äúview posts by date‚Äù thing is set up is neat. Probably using Dataview to do that? [Maybe](https://www.andricheli.com/02Blog/üë©üèΩ%E2%80%8Düíª+Productivity/Obsidian+Publish) based on tags too. *Interesting*. Explore more

Was about ready to blow [this one](https://notes.joschua.io/50+Slipbox/Obsidian+Publish) off, but has some interesting looking tips on using [[publish\|publish]], so keeping [this](https://notes.joschua.io/50+Slipbox/Obsidian+Publish) around to review later. Otherwise was a bit like just looking at a vault. 

[Chad](https://mister-chad.com/mind+gardens/!+mind+garden) has some thoughts on the whole [[mind garden\|mind garden]] thing, might be handy to read for getting things set up, knowing what to put where, etc. The fading sidebars are nifty too. Probably some CSS stuff that could potentially be borrowed. Read stuff. View source.
