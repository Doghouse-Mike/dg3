# After that Another Glass of Wine

Feeling shitty and listening to some [Amanda Fucking Palmer](http://amandapalmer.net) this morning. My daughter wakes up, and asks to listen to her favourite song. After some (dread-filled) investigation, turns out it was this she wanted, stoked! And feeling slightly better.  
(The line I stole for the title was the clue that settled it, "It goes tssssssshshshshshhshshs." wasn't cutting it.)
